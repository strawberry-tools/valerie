## Install Valerie

### Linux

There are a few ways you can install Valerie on a Linux amd64 or arm64 system.

#### Debian Package (.deb)
You can install Valerie into an Apt based computer by download the `.deb` file to the desired system.

For graphical systems, you can download it from the [GitHub Releases page][gh-releases].
Many distros allow you to double-click the file to install.
Via terminal, you can do the following:

```bash
wget https://github.com/strawberry-tools/valerie/releases/download/v0.1.0/valerie_0.1.0_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i valeri_0.1.0_amd64.deb
```

`0.1.0` and `amd64` may need to be replaced with your desired version and CPU architecture respectively.

#### Binary Install
You can download and run the raw Valerie binary from the [GitHub Releases page][gh-releases] if you don't want to use any package manager.
Simply download the tarball for your OS and architecture and extract the binary to somewhere in your `PATH`.
Here's one way to do this with `curl` and `tar`:

```bash
dlURL="https://github.com/strawberry-tools/valerie/releases/download/v0.1.0/valerie-v0.1.0-linux-amd64.tar.gz"
curl -sSL $dlURL | sudo tar -xz -C /usr/local/bin valerie
```

`0.1.0` and `amd64` may need to be replaced with your desired version and CPU architecture respectively.

### macOS

There are two ways you can install Valerie on a macOS (amd64) system.
Support for M1 macs (the arm64 chip) is coming later in 2021 if there's demand.

#### Brew (recommended)

Installing Valerie via brew is a simple one-liner:

```bash
brew install felicianotech/tap/valerie
```

#### Binary Install
You can download and run the raw Valerie binary from the [GitHub Releases page][gh-releases] if you don't want to use Brew.
Simply download the tarball for your OS and architecture and extract the binary to somewhere in your `PATH`.
Here's one way to do this with `curl` and `tar`:

```bash
dlURL="https://github.com/strawberry-tools/valerie/releases/download/v0.1.0/valerie-v0.1.0-macos-amd64.tar.gz"
curl -sSL $dlURL | sudo tar -xz -C /usr/local/bin valerie
```

`0.1.0` may need to be replaced with your desired version.

### Continuous Integration (CI) Systems

Valerie can be installed in a CI environment pretty much the same way you'd install it on your own computer.
There is 1st-party support for some CI platforms in order to make the process easier.

#### CircleCI
Valerie will be available as an orb in the near future.


#### GitHub Actions
Coming soon, probably.
Open an Issue to request it and demonstrate demand.


## Usage

The basic idea is to pass a URL you want to check like this:

```bash
valerie validate "https://www.feliciano.tech"
```

Run `valerie help` to see all commands available.
